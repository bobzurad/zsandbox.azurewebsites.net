A react app made from scratch.

Configured to use:

* TypeScript
* SASS
* Image File Loading (png, svg, jpg, gif)
* Jest
* ESLint

Created from (except for linting) https://medium.com/@tim.givois.mendez/create-a-react-project-from-scratch-without-create-react-app-f02fce4e05b

For linting, I'm using ESLint with airbnb (and some rules that I personally prefer) from here: https://itnext.io/how-to-setup-typescript-eslint-prettier-and-react-in-5-minutes-44cfe8af5081
