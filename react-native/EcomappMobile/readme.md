# Ecomapp Mobile App

This is a mobile app created with `npx react-native init`

This project interacts with data from the API at https://github.com/bobzurad/zsandbox.azurewebsites.net/tree/master/java/ecomapp

## Prerequisites and Dev Setup

This project requires NodeJS 14 or later. To setup your dev environment, follow the official [React Native Guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) and select the `React Native CLI QuickStart`. This project **DOES NOT** use Expo! Stop at "Creating a new application", because this application is already created :)
