# unit-testing-vue

Note: To get lint-on-save working, I had to add this to the repository's `.vscode/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "eslint.workingDirectories": [
    "./VueMastery/unit-testing-vue"
  ]
}
```

## Project setup

```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```

npm run lint
```

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
