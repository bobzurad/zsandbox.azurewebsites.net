# next-level-vue

## Following along

We encourage you to follow the course on Vue Mastery, and code along with us. This course has tags representing the start and finish of each level, just in case you get stuck. Here's the start and ending code of each lesson, if you'd like to download them.

## Project setup

```bash
npm install -g @vue/cli
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```bash
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```bash
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files

```bash
npm run lint
```

### VS Code config

Install the following extensions:

- Vetur
- ESLint (config in .eslintrc.js)
- Prettier (config in .prettierrc.js)

Add this to your user settings.json:

```bash
    "vetur.validation.template": false,
    "eslint.validate": [
        {
            "language": "vue",
            "autoFix": true
        },
        {
            "language": "html",
            "autoFix": true
        },
        {
            "language": "javascript",
            "autoFix": true
        }
    ],
    "eslint.autoFixOnSave": true,
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
```
